# 4.5.1 Backend API Server

The Backend API Server initializes an Express.js application that serves as the core API endpoint for the CTF Challenge Platform, handling database operations, authentication, and secure session management. The server imports essential dependencies including Express for HTTP routing, bcryptjs for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for authentication tokens, PostgreSQL Pool for database connectivity, cookie-parser for session handling, and helmet for security headers. After initializing the Express instance and extracting environment variables for port and JWT secret configuration, the server implements comprehensive security middleware using Helmet to protect against common web vulnerabilities. The security configuration includes HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with one-year maximum age and preload capability to force HTTPS connections, alongside protective headers for frameguard (clickjacking prevention), noSniff (MIME-type sniffing prevention), XSS filter, and referrer policy set to 'no-referrer'. The server also implements conditional HTTPS redirection for production environments and configures CORS with credentials support to enable secure cross-origin requests from the frontend while maintaining cookie-based authentication.
