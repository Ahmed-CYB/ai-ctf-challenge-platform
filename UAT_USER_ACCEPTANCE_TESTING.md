**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Project:** AI CTF Challenge Platform

## 5.3 User Acceptance Testing

### 5.3.1 Introduction

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of testing where end users verify that the AI-Powered CTF Challenge Platform meets their requirements and works as expected in real-world scenarios. This testing ensures the platform is ready for deployment and provides a satisfactory user experience for creating, deploying, and managing CTF challenges.

### Purpose of UAT

- Verify the platform works as expected from a user's perspective
- Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to use
- Validate that all features function correctly
- Identify any usability issues or bugs
- Confirm the platform meets user needs for CTF challenge creation and deployment

### Testing Approach

Testers should use the platform as a regular user would, performing common tasks such as registering an account, creating challenges through the AI chat interface, deploying challenges, and accessing challenge environments. Focus on the user experience rather than technical implementation details.
